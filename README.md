PrivacyGuides.org owners and moderators should not be trusted.

The moderators of PrivacyGuides on Reddit think they have the right to take control of 2 sub reddits
they did not own and forward them to their own new sub and website.

They did this by making false and misleading claims to reddit that the owner of the subs was not active 
although the comment itself is true, their intent is what is at question.

They did not take over the subs to continue them, they took control for the sole purpose of 
closing those subs down and then forwarding people to a new sub which they created.

Is this the way of the new reddit system? Take control of something so you can benefit?

If the mods of PrivacyGuides.org wanted to create a new group all they had to do was exactly what they did, 
create PrivacyGuides.org and create the sub along with github user and advise people WHY they were leaving PrivacyTools.

That would be the honorable thing to do. This is NOT what they did.

First, they took control of /r/PrivacyToolsIO and /r/PrivacyTools, then https://github.com/privacytools/

They then closed those subs and users and forwarded them to PrivacyGuides.org

This is all deceptive, underhanded, and outright thievery.

No one should support this kind of conduct by people that call themselves moderators. 
No one who would do something like this should even be able to remain as a moderator as they have proven they cannot be trusted.

Privacytools.io is owned by https://www.reddit.com/user/BurungHantu who started and 
founded https://www.reddit.com/r/PrivacyTools/ and https://www.reddit.com/r/PrivacyToolsIO/ as well as https://github.com/privacytools/

Take notice that PrivacyGuides.org has taken control of those accounts and forwarded them to their own accounts and domain PrivacyGuides.org

If that is not theft and fraud on the part of PrivacyGuides.org what is?

Considering they already conducted themselves in an underhanded, deceptive way who is to say they will not do it again. 
How do you trust someone was they have already proven themselves to be dishonest and untrustworthy?

Any sub owner that has these people as mods should seriously think whether they can really be trusted after what has transpired at PrivacyGuides.org. 
I sure as hell would never trust anyone who did what they did, in the manner they did it, and continue to do.

PrivacyGuides.org intentionally, deceptively, and underhandedly stole the Intellectual Property of someone else.
